The INSPECT–PBEE program is designed to simplify the process of structural modeling as well Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering (PBEE) utilizing the IDARC-2D program. The creation of the input text file for IDARC-2D is facilitated by the GUI pre-processor, while running analyses and manipulating outputs are fully automated by the GUI post-processor in INSPECT–PBEE. The high-level handling and automation capabilities provided by INSPECT–PBEE liberate the structural/earthquake engineer from the distractions of maneuvering through the minute syntax details. Thus, transforming the PBEE from a tedious exercise into a streamlined and seamless experience without compromising its inherent rigor. INSPECT–PBEE would be found useful and appealing to structural/earthquake engineering students, researchers and practitioners alike. The freely distributed executable version of the IDRAC-2D program [which is made free and publically available at this webpage: [http://civil.eng.buffalo.edu/idarc2d50/], is included within the INSPECT–PBEE package. The redistribution of the IDRAC-2D executable is done with the explicit written permission from the IDARC-2D copyright holders, represented by Prof. Andrei M. Reinhorn of the University at Buffalo-SUNY.

SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLAIMER
The computational tool [program] “INSPECT–PBEE”, herein referred to as the program. The ownership of the program remains with the developers. Whether subroutines of the program or the whole program is incorporated into the executable binary code or the source code of any other program(s), any program(s) utilizing or containing INSPECT–PBEE or any of its subroutines shall explicitly acknowledge acceptance of the subsequent DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. Furthermore, such incorporation of the INSPECT–PBEE program does not create any business relationship between the developers of INSPECT–PBEE, nor their institutions, and the developed or derived program’s user(s). The names of INSPECT–PBEE program, its authors and their institutions, shall not be used in the promotion of any such developed or derived products without prior explicit written permission from the authors of INSPECT–PBEE. 

The creators of the INSPECT–PBEE program spared no effort in verifying it; significant time and effort have been put towards its development and testing. However, the authors do not accept any responsibility for inadequate use of the program or any analysis results produced by it. The ultimate responsibility of verifying analysis results rests solely upon the user. The user should have adequate knowledge of structural dynamics, nonlinear analysis and modeling, earthquake engineering as well performance-based seismic design and evaluation techniques. The subsequent DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY applies to the user of the program INSPECT–PBEE and all of its associated subroutines.


DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
The INSPECT–PBEE program, all its data files, and all its associated subroutines, are provided on an “AS-IS” basis without any warranty. The authors and their institutions disclaim any and all liability for direct or indirect damages resulting from use of the program. The authors and their institutions make no warranties, explicitly or implicitly, that the program is error-free or is consistent with any particular set of standards, or that the program will meet any particular application requirements. The program should not be relied on for solving any engineering problems where an erroneous solution may cause potential personal injury or property loss. If the program is used in such a manner, it should be explicitly understood that it is done at the user’s discretion and own risk.
